pyStocks is a stock portfolio site that you can use to practice your skills in the market- with realtime data.

pyStocks is made in python and uses Flask, and works by gathering real-time data surrounding the stock market 
using [finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io/), an amazing free API.

As you can see, if your margin's are in the positive, they'll be displayed in green!
But watch out, the market moves fast and so does the value of stocks.
